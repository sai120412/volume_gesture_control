Volume Control Using Hand Gestures A Python-based application that allows users to control their system's volume intuitively using hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning models to detect and interpret hand gestures in real time.

Features Real-time hand gesture detection and tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Intuitive gesture-based volume control: Adjust volume by changing the distance between two specific fingers (e.g., thumb and index finger). Mute/unmute the system with a specific gesture. High accuracy and smooth performance with efficient image processing algorithms. Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Technologies Used Python: Primary programming language. OpenCV: For real-time video capture and image processing. MediaPipe: For hand landmark detection and tracking.
